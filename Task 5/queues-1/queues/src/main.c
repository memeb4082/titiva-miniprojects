/******************************************************************************
 *
 * This example demonstrates passing a complex structure by value as well as
 * by reference using FreeRTOS's queue between multiple tasks.  Two queues are
 * set up with one for passing messages by value and another for passing by
 * reference.  A total of six tasks are created with four of them sending
 * messages through the two queues while the other two tasks receiving the
 * message from the two queues either by value or by reference.  The four tasks
 * transmit their messages at different times.  Their time stamp is sent as
 * the data as part of the message.  Once the data is received, the receiving
 * tasks print the task ID and its corresponding time stamp on the terminal
 * window.
 *
 * This example uses UARTprintf for output of UART messages.  UARTprintf is not
 * a thread-safe API and is only being used for simplicity of the demonstration
 * and in a controlled manner.
 *
 * Open a terminal with 115,200 8-N-1 to see the output for this demo.
