/******************************************************************************
 *
 * The Hello task creates a simple task to handle the UART output for the
 * 'Hello World!' message.  A loop is executed five times with a count down
 * before ending with the self-termination of the task that prints the UART
 * message by use of vTaskDelete.  The loop also includes a one second delay
 * that is achieved by using vTaskDelay.
 *
 * This example uses UARTprintf for output of UART messages.  UARTprintf is not
 * a thread-safe API and is only being used for simplicity of the demonstration
 * and in a controlled manner.
