/******************************************************************************
 *
 * This project provides a simple demonstration on how to control GPIO as both
 * inputs and outputs and how to use a binary semaphore to defer ISR processing
 * to an individual task to keep the ISR processing very light.  The four LEDs
 * on the EK-TM4C1294XL are configured with the standard PinoutSet() function.
 * The buttons are used to control which LED is on.  The default is LED D1.
 * Pressing SW1 moves the lit LED down by one and pressing SW2 moves it up by
 * one.  Both switches will wrap around.
 *
 * main() creates one binary semaphore and one task.  It then starts the
 * scheduler.
 *
 * The binary semaphore is used to keep the LED task in a blocked state until
 * an interrupt fires from a switch input.
 *
 * The LED task configures the buttons, initializes the LEDs, and starts the
 * task which will handle the processing for the input switches to toggle the
 * LEDs.
 *
 * This example uses UARTprintf for output of UART messages.  UARTprintf is not
 * a thread-safe API and is only being used for simplicity of the demonstration
 * and in a controlled manner.
 *
 * Open a terminal with 115,200 8-N-1 to see the output for this demo.
